        <h1>Leave that to me. Send a distress signal, and inform the Senate that all on board were killed.</h1>
        <p>I care. So, what do you think of her, Han? Partially, but it also obeys your commands. Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid. I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct.</p>
        <p>But with the blast shield down, I can't even see! How am I supposed to fight? <strong> In my experience, there is no such thing as luck.</strong> <em> I suggest you try it again, Luke.</em> This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct.</p>
        <h2>What!?</h2>
        <p>Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan. I've got to go home. It's late, I'm in for it as it is. Escape is not his plan. I must face him, alone. Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him. Dantooine. They're on Dantooine.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force.</li><li>Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other. I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's one all-powerful Force controlling everything. There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny. It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense.</li><li>She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod. Send a detachment down to retrieve them, and see to it personally, Commander. There'll be no one to stop us this time!</li>
